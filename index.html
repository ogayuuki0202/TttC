      <p>The participants discussed a wide range of experiments and research related to plasma wind tunnel tests, superorbital reentry, aeroshell technology, aerodynamics on Mars, communications blackout, and radiation measurements during atmospheric entry. Key areas of focus included gas injection to reduce heating rate, flexible aeroshell deployment, real gas aerodynamics on Mars, and the development of high-precision radiation models. The discussions also touched on the application of forced expansion methods, infrared radiation measurements, aerodynamic heating tests, and the impact of surface catalysis on communications blackout. Additionally, the participants highlighted the importance of numerical simulations, arc-heated wind tunnels, and aeroballistic range development for Mars exploration missions.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to explosion effects mitigation, including numerical analysis, primary blast injury mechanisms, future technology prospects, blast wave mitigation experiments, gas detonation effects, equation of state development, and blast wave theory. Discussions also delved into blast reduction techniques using water, urethane, traps, and droplets, as well as environmental resistance evaluations and high-velocity particle emitters. The participants explored blast wave propagation in various scenarios, such as L-shaped pipes, straight pipes with convexities, and enclosed spaces, while also examining blast wave formation processes, pressure waveforms, and impulse performance.</p>

      <p>The participants discussed various aspects of improving the resolution and accuracy of three-dimensional flow field measurements using the background-oriented schlieren (BOS) method. Key topics included enhancing spatial resolution, utilizing neural network-based super-resolution techniques, adapting to vibration environments, and exploring the impact of background image tilt on output. Additionally, there was a focus on techniques such as shadowgrab video generation, SSIM-based video quality assessment, and the use of AR markers for accuracy in challenging environments. The transition from laser interferometry computed tomography to background-oriented schlieren computed tomography was also highlighted as a potential advancement in flow field visualization.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to electromagnetic aerobraking and MHD shock layer expansion, including CFD analysis, ionizing agent-filled aperators, aerocapture in deep space, and airflow diagnosis using LAS. Participants discussed numerical simulations, experimental analyses, and verification experiments to enhance understanding and performance in these areas. The impact of ionization promoters, ionizing agents, and electromagnetic coils on aerobraking and shock layer expansion was a key focus, along with the development of methods for improving MHD shock layer effects. The discussions also delved into the effects of gas species dependence, wedge shapes, and test flow improvements in expansion tubes like HEK-X.</p>

      <p>The participants discussed a wide range of advancements in high-speed pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) and temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) technology for aerodynamic analysis. Key topics included the development of ultra-fast response PSP for pressure and heat flow evaluation, visualization of shock waves and sonic booms using anodized aluminum-coated PSP, and the application of TSP in shock tube experiments and basic aerodynamic tests. The focus was on improving measurement accuracy, response times, and visualization capabilities in analyzing high-speed flows and supersonic phenomena. Additionally, considerations were made for the preparation methods and correction techniques to enhance the performance of PSP in various testing environments.</p>
