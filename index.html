      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, including supersonic flow control, hypersonic airflow analysis, droplet atomization, boundary layer control, and numerical simulations using various methods and solvers. Participants delved into areas such as shock wave propagation, hydrodynamic interactions between particles, material studies for aircraft applications, and high-speed crash test procedures. The discussions also touched on turbulence models, boundary layer transitions, and the use of plasma and MHD flow control techniques in high-speed environments.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to impact damage analysis, including crack propagation in glass, stress analysis under moving loads, impact resistance evaluation in laminates, and damage behavior of various materials under high-speed impact. The discussions also delved into the influence of material composition, mesoscale structures, and bonded interfaces on damage progression, as well as stress wave propagation and real-time visualization of damage processes during impact events. Additionally, the consultation explored dynamic crushing tests, strain rate distribution, and molecular dynamics analysis of damage in metallic and polymer materials.</p>

      <p>The discussions centered on enhancing the resolution and accuracy of three-dimensional flow field measurements using the background-oriented schlieren (BOS) method. Participants explored techniques such as neural network-based super-resolution, adaptive optics, and Wavelet transform amplitude focusing to improve spatial resolution. The focus was on applications in supersonic flows, vibration environments, and atmospheric turbulence, with considerations for shock wave measurements and density field reconstructions. Additionally, there was interest in transitioning from laser interferometry computed tomography to background-oriented schlieren computed tomography and utilizing multiple frequency components for validation in the BOS method.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to shock wave applications, including brain astrocyte activation, cancer care, wood modification, brain-mimicking models, gene and drug delivery, cerebral hemodynamics, traumatic brain injuries, and angiogenesis therapy. Discussions also delved into shock wave effects on cell morphology, intracellular calcium levels, blood-brain barrier disruption, glial responses, and higher brain functions in mice. Additionally, there was exploration into laser-induced shock waves, transcranial impulse stimulation, and the interaction of shock waves with negative pressure on helmeted head models. The consultation highlighted the diverse and evolving research landscape in the field of shock wave technology and its medical applications.</p>

      <p>The participants discussed a wide range of advancements in high-speed pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) and temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) technology for aerodynamic analysis. Key topics included the development of ultra-fast response PSP for pressure and heat flow evaluation, visualization of shock waves and sonic booms using anodized aluminum-coated PSP, and the application of TSP in shock tube experiments and basic aerodynamic tests. The focus was on improving measurement accuracy, response times, and visualization capabilities in analyzing high-speed flows and supersonic phenomena. Additionally, considerations were made for factors affecting PSP performance, such as preparation methods and response delays due to shock waves.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a range of topics including the impact of heat treatment on high-entropy alloys, momentum transfer in hypervelocity collisions, crater formation in aluminum alloys, shock compression treatment on lightweight alloys, and the effect of impactor structure on crater shape and internal structure. The discussions also delved into self-forging copper fragments, deformation processes in aluminum alloys, and the influence of aluminum particle addition on detonation cell width. Additionally, microwave generation from hypervelocity collisions with aluminum plates was explored.</p>
