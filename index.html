      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to shock wave interactions, including shock wave modulation, boundary layer control, turbulence effects, and shock wave generation in various scenarios. Participants discussed shock wave interactions with metal droplets, flames, vortex rings, and turbulence, emphasizing factors like jet diameter, pipe inner diameter, and electric field influence. The focus was on understanding shock wave behavior, suppression of shock wave-boundary layer separation, and energy deposition in these interactions. The consultation also delved into shock wave instability, rebound shock wave generation, and cavitation effects due to sudden acceleration.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to shock wave-induced phenomena, including molecular dynamics simulations, stress analysis in various materials, structural changes under shock wave propagation, and dynamic behavior of different substances under impact loading. Participants delved into areas such as material structure dynamics, stress wave propagation, shock-induced phase transitions, and the impact of shock waves on various materials like concrete, rock, and polymers. The discussions also touched on topics like shock wave attenuation, viscoelastic properties, and the behavior of different materials under high-speed deformation and pressure wave stimulation.</p>

      <p>The discussions covered a wide range of topics related to underwater explosions, shock waves, microbubbles, and their effects. Participants delved into areas such as bubble generation, cavitation, shock wave interactions with various materials, and the use of microbubbles for different applications. The research explored the influence of factors like bubble size, initiation depth, and object velocity on the phenomena studied. Additionally, there was a focus on practical applications such as marine fouling removal, dye decomposition, and deposit removal from ship bottoms using techniques involving shock waves and microbubbles. The studies also looked at visualization techniques to understand the interactions better and proposed methods for underwater explosion mitigation using deformable porous media.</p>

      <p>The participants discussed a wide range of topics related to deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) and detonation propagation. Key areas of interest included acceleration and mobility of DDT, numerical analysis of flame effects, suppression techniques using mesh walls and porous materials, detonation characteristics in various channel configurations, flame acceleration at junctions, detonation initiation and reinitiation processes, and visualization techniques for studying detonation wave structures and interactions. The discussions also touched on factors influencing DDT distance, optimization of detonation-promoting structures, and evaluation of detonation initiation distances. The participants highlighted the importance of understanding detonation processes in various scenarios, such as internal explosions, curved walls, and interactions with fuel liquids.</p>

      <p>The participants discussed various techniques and methods to enhance the resolution and accuracy of three-dimensional flow field measurements using background-oriented schlieren (BOS) method. Topics included spatial resolution improvement, shadowgrab video generation, SSIM-based analysis, 3D reconstruction, neural network-based super-resolution techniques, and quantitative visualization measurements. The focus was on visualizing and analyzing flow fields in supersonic and sonic flows, utilizing innovative approaches like light field optical systems, camera arrays, and telecentric optical systems. Additionally, there was an emphasis on quantitative density and temperature measurements in wind tunnels, as well as comparisons between BOS methods and numerical analyses for flow field reconstruction.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to plasma flow, arc heating, and temperature measurements in various gas flows. Participants discussed techniques such as laser Thomson scattering, optical emission spectroscopy, and laser absorption spectroscopy for temperature and enthalpy measurements. The focus was on characterizing plasma flows, measuring temperatures in arc gas flows, and developing models for enthalpy measurement. Additionally, there was interest in real-time observation of recession during arc heating testing and high-speed particle injection using arc heating.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of applications for shock waves in various fields, including cancer care, vascular treatment, wood modification, regenerative medicine, gene and drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and defense systems. Participants discussed the development of shock wave generators, high-speed photography of shock wave generation, and the use of shock waves in medical therapies like angiogenesis and drug delivery. Laser-induced shock waves were also highlighted for tissue regeneration and culture system development. The potential for shock waves to permeabilize cell membranes for gene and drug delivery purposes was a key focus, along with the investigation of innovative therapies for conditions like ischemic heart disease.</p>

      <p>The discussions revolved around various aspects of rotary detonation engines, including combustion chamber flow shape, injector design, operational tests with different fuels, ignition methods, and performance analysis. Participants explored the impact of swirl injectors, diverging channels, and simplification on engine operation and propulsive performance. Additionally, studies focused on pressure gain, pressure loss, and the use of different propellants like hydrogen, oxygen, and methane. The research also delved into operational frequency, powder feed rate, and self-actuating systems in rotary detonation engines and pulse detonation spraying.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to expansion tube testing, including temperature measurements, impurity analysis, airflow simulations, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow diagnostics, and gas flow generation. Participants discussed the applicability of various techniques like TDLAS, FLEET, optical emission spectroscopy, and non-contact pseudo-temperature probes in expansion tube experiments. Suggestions were made for improving CFD simulations, addressing non-uniform airflow effects, and evaluating ultra-high-speed airflow and radiation environments in expansion tube tests. Overall, the focus was on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of experimental and computational methods in expansion tube research.</p>
