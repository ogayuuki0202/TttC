      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to laser-induced shock waves, microbubbles, cavitation, and stress wave formation. Key areas of interest included femtosecond laser-induced micro-shock waves, bubble dynamics analysis, cavitation bubble generation and disappearance, and high-speed observation of cell morphology post-shock wave irradiation. The research also delved into pressure characteristics of laser-induced shock waves, residual snow stress field formation, and the impact of acoustic impedance matching on blast wave collision. Additionally, studies focused on optical wave propagation in deep tissue and the visualization of various bubble-attached structures.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of advanced measurement techniques in aerodynamics, including 3D density measurement, PIV analysis, drag coefficient evaluations, turbulence visualization, and flow field quantification in various supersonic and hypersonic scenarios. Participants focused on methods like Schlieren visualization, glow discharge plasma, and spectroscopic measurements to study aerodynamic phenomena such as sonic flow, re-entry capsules, and free-flying objects. The discussions also delved into drag coefficient determination, pressure distribution measurements, and velocity fluctuation analysis in high-speed environments.</p>

      <p>The discussions centered around enhancing spatial resolution in three-dimensional flow field measurements using background-oriented schlieren (BOS) method. Participants explored techniques like neural network-based super-resolution, adaptive optics, and shadowgrab video generation. They also delved into topics such as flow field visualization, shock wave measurement, and the transition from laser interferometry computed tomography to BOS-CT. The emphasis was on improving accuracy, resolution, and visualization in BOS applications, particularly in supersonic flows and vibration environments.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to hypervelocity impact and damage analysis, including crack propagation in glass materials, impact resistance evaluation in laminates, and damage behavior of various materials under high-speed impact. Participants delved into the influence of glass composition, mechanical properties, laminated layers, and bonded interfaces on damage progression. The discussions also touched on impact resistance in aircraft materials, fracture processes in different materials, and real-time visualization of damage formation processes during impact events. Molecular dynamics analysis was highlighted as a key method for studying damage in both polymer/metal composite structures and metallic materials.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to shock wave interactions in supersonic flow, including characteristics of oblique shock wave interference, effects of viscosity, turbulence, and reflector conditions, as well as the impact of various factors on shock wave formations and reflections. Participants discussed the influence of different shapes, rise times, and maximum pressures on turbulent interactions, as well as the transition from weak to strong shock waves. Additionally, the study delved into the collision processes of supersonic jets and shock waves, unimolecular reactions behind shock waves, and the modulation of shock fronts by grid turbulence. The research also explored the interaction of flames, vortex rings, and flexible bodies with shock waves in various flow conditions.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to shock wave exposure and brain injuries, including activation of astrocytes, blood-brain barrier disruption, and molecular dynamics of cerebral hemodynamics. Discussions also delved into shock wave behavior using brain-mimicking models, laser-induced shock wave research, and the effects of blast shock waves on higher brain functions in mice. The interaction of shock waves with negative pressure on helmeted head models and recent trends in brain injury research were also highlighted.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics including stress analysis, shock compression, impact loading, and structural changes in various materials under dynamic conditions. Participants delved into areas such as the behavior of concrete, rock materials, glass, and polymer under impact loading, as well as stress wave propagation and the influence of mesoscale structures on compression. The discussions highlighted the importance of understanding the response of materials to dynamic forces and the need for further research in these areas to enhance our knowledge of material behavior under extreme conditions.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to expansion tube testing, including temperature measurements, impurity analysis, airflow simulations, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow diagnostics, and gas flow generation. Participants discussed the applicability of various techniques such as TDLAS, FLEET, optical emission spectroscopy, and non-contact pseudo-temperature probes in expansion tube experiments. Suggestions were made for improving CFD simulations and addressing non-uniform airflow effects in expansion tube testing. The focus was on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of experimental and computational methods for studying ultra-high-speed airflow and simulating radiation environments in expansion tubes.</p>

      <p>The consultation highlighted a focus on the impact of hypervelocity collisions on aluminum alloys, particularly in relation to crater formation, shock compression treatment, impactor structure effects, and deformation processes. Additionally, the study of self-forging copper fragments and the influence of aluminum particle addition on detonation cell width were noted. The research also delved into microwave generation from hypervelocity collisions with aluminum plates.</p>
