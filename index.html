      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to detonation and combustion processes, including deflagration-to-detonation transitions, flame acceleration phenomena, shock wave effects, and fluid transport in various engine configurations. Participants discussed experimental studies, numerical simulations, and visualization techniques to understand detonation wave propagation, wavefront structures, and the impact of sidewall disturbances on detonation waves. The focus was on improving understanding of detonation processes in different environments, such as scramjet engines, blast simulators, and rotating detonation engines, with the goal of enhancing safety and efficiency in these systems.</p>

      <p>The participants discussed a wide range of research topics related to aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, focusing on density measurements, drag coefficients, heat flow evaluations, and flow control techniques in supersonic and hypersonic flows. The studies included methods for quantitative density measurement, drag coefficient determination, temperature distribution measurement, and pressure distribution measurement on free-flying objects. The research also delved into computational fluid analysis, shock wave shapes, and electromagnetic force control in re-entry vehicles. The emphasis was on advancing measurement techniques and understanding aerodynamic behaviors in high-speed fluid phenomena.</p>

      <p>The participants discussed various aspects of improving the resolution and accuracy of three-dimensional flow field measurements using the background-oriented schlieren (BOS) method. Key points included investigating spatial resolution, enhancing resolution in supersonic flows, utilizing neural network-based super-resolution techniques, and adapting the BOS method for shock wave measurements and flow visualization around flying objects. The discussions also touched on techniques such as phase shift interferometry, AR markers for vibration environments, and the impact of background image tilt and defocusing on density field reconstruction. Overall, the focus was on advancing the BOS method through innovative approaches and technologies to enhance spatial resolution and accuracy in flow field analysis.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to heating tests, plasma flow, and temperature measurements in various experimental setups. Participants discussed issues such as the influence of impurities on heating rate measurements, real-time observation of recession during arc heating testing, and the characterization of different plasma flows. The use of spectroscopic techniques, optical measurements, and electromagnetic force models were highlighted as important tools for studying high-temperature materials and plasma interactions. Additionally, the development of new measurement probes and diagnostic methods for evaluating plasma flows and enthalpy in different experimental conditions was emphasized.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to laser-induced shock waves, including propagation behavior, bubble dynamics, stress wave formation, pressure distribution, high-speed observation, and numerical simulations. Participants also discussed applications such as underwater explosions, shock wave generation mechanisms, bubble dynamics analysis, and laser ablation effects. Additionally, the impact of laser focus in different interfaces, optical wave propagation in tissues, and shock wave interactions were highlighted as areas of interest for further research.</p>

      <p>Participants highlighted the development and application of advanced paints for high-speed analysis in aerodynamics and supersonic phenomena. Key areas of focus included temperature-sensitive paint for shock tube experiments, pressure-sensitive paint for surface pressure measurement, and the visualization of sonic booms and shock wave phenomena using specialized paints like anodized aluminum pressure-sensitive paint (AA-PSP). The emphasis was on achieving ultra-fast response times, simultaneous measurement of pressure and heat flow, and the evaluation of properties of these paints for accurate aerodynamic testing. Additionally, there was a call for addressing challenges such as response delay correction in pressure-sensitive paint due to shock waves and the effect of preparation methods on paint structure and response variation.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to hypervelocity impact, including crack propagation, damage progression, material composition effects, and debris impact on glass and other materials. Participants discussed the influence of mechanical properties, laminated layers, and bonded interfaces on damage formation and progression. The research also delved into the behavior of brittle materials, high-speed impact experiments, and real-time visualization of damage processes during hypervelocity impacts. The ultimate fracture process in quartz glass, deformation of high-entropy alloys, and window glass destruction in buildings were among the specific areas of interest.</p>

      <p>The consultation covered a wide range of topics related to expansion tube testing, including temperature measurements, impurity analysis, airflow simulations, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow diagnostics, and ultra-high-speed gas flows. Participants discussed the applicability of various techniques like TDLAS, FLEET, optical emission spectroscopy, and non-contact pseudo-temperature probes in expansion tube experiments. Suggestions were made for improving CFD simulations and evaluating expansion tube airflow for simulating radiation environments. The focus was on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of experimental and computational methods in expansion tube research.</p>

      <p>The discussions revolved around the impact treatment and crater formation in aluminum alloys under hypervelocity conditions. Specific topics included the effect of impactor structure on crater shape and internal structure, shock compression treatment on high-entropy alloys, and the prediction of deformation processes during crater formation. Additionally, the impact of aluminum particle addition on detonation cell width and microwave generation from hypervelocity collisions with aluminum plates were highlighted.</p>

      <p>The participants presented a range of advanced techniques for visualizing and analyzing high-speed flows, including rarefied conditions, sonic and supersonic flows, and metal jets. Methods such as flash X-ray imaging, point diffraction interferometry, and Schlieren visualization were highlighted for studying phenomena like jet density, shock waves, and flow around objects like spheres and Busemann biplanes. The focus was on understanding flow behavior at different Reynolds numbers and exploring the application limits of these visualization and analysis tools in various experimental setups.</p>
